	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Job Description </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 20px;">
	  While working at Innovasium Digital I worked as a full stack web and mobile developer. I worked with the designers and other developers to build React and Gatsby sites from the ground up.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Many of the things i did at innovasium include:
	  <br>
	  - Built responsive websites using the <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> framework and <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a>
	  <br>
	  - Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">sass</a> and <a href="https://www.styled-components.com/">styled components</a> to design pages
	  <br>
	  - Using <a href="https://github.com/">github</a> as a content management system as well as for performing code reviews
	  <br>
	  - Practicing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile software development</a>
	  <br>
	  - Writing backend code using <a href="https://graphql.org/"> graphql</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> to run the application
	  <br>
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Goals </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 20px">
	  My main goals while working for Innovasium was to increase my abilities as a programmer, as well as grow within a profesional environment. I wanted to work on my communication skills as well as my
    self management skills
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  My goals for the term were:
	  <br>
	  1. Improve web developement development skills
	  <br>
	  2. Take on more leadership during development
	  <br>
	  3. Better explain what I'm working on during stand up meetings
	  </p>
	  <br>
	   <p style="font-size: 20px">
	  Having standup meetings every morning helped me immensely with getting more comfortable with agile. It also helped with my communication as I needed to be able to articulate what I had been working on.
    These allowed me to check in with the other developers to see which tasks are the most urgent.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Reflecting on my goals and everything I've learned while working at Innovasium, I believe that I was sucessful in achieving my goals. My web development and css skills increased very much during my coop.
    creating pages from the ground up really helped my problem solving and planning abilities. I got the change to increase my leadership abilities through onboarding new employees during my term working there.
    Over the course of my standup meetings I feel that I improved a lot at explaining what I was working on.
	  </p>
