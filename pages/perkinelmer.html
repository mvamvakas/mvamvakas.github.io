	  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	  My name is Michael Vamvakas, I am a second/third year Software Engineering Student with a minor in Mathematics. This page is a reflection of my 8 month work (May 2018 - December 2018) 
	  at Perkin Elmer as an Associate QA Engineer. In this report I will talk about the numerous ways I grew as a Student, Employee, and Programmer.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Employer Information </h2>

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Job Description </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	  While working at PerkinElmer as an Associate QA Engineer, my main job was to assist in testing <a href="https://www.perkinelmer.com/product/signals-medical-review-smr">Signals Medical Review</a>. My role
	  within the team was to test all the bugfixes/changes, both manually and through automation. Working as a tester helped me understand how much testing is required when building software and how important
	  it is to make sure that every time code is added that the added code doesn't disrupt functionality within the system.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Many of the things I did at PerkinElmer Include:
	  <br>
	  - Writing an automated test harness in Java using the <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium framework</a>, as well as <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a>, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, and <a href="https://www.perkinelmer.com/product/signals-medical-review-smr">JUnit</a>.
	  <br>
	  - Running automated test cases in parallel.
	  <br>
	  - Using Jira, creating test cases, pushing issues from "in test" to "done" after running them through all the related test cycles.
	  <br>
	  - Sas Programming to update existing data sets to use for soak testing.
	  <br>
	  - Stability testing, testing all the parameters for specific functionalities within the system, testing concurency within the system.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Goals </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 20px">
	  My main goals while working for PerkinElmer was to increase my abilities as a programmer, as well as grow within a proffesional environment. I wanted to work on my communication skills as well as be more
	  comfortable talking in front of my team.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  My goals were:
	  <br>
	  1. Be more confortable with agile development
	  <br>
	  2. Learn the selenium framework and improve my java skills
	  <br>
	  3. Be less afraid to ask for help if I don't understand something
	  </p>
	  <br>
	   <p style="font-size: 20px">
	  Having standup meetings every morning helped me immensly with getting more comfortable with agile. It also helped with my communication as I needed to be able to articulate what I had been working on. Once 
	  a month my supervisor and I would meet to reflect on my goals and to see what other steps could be taken to reaching them, which was very helpful for my learning.
