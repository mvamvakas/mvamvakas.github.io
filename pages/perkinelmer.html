	  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	  My name is Michael Vamvakas, I am a second/third year Software Engineering Student with a minor in Mathematics. This page is a reflection of my 8 month work (May 2018 - December 2018) 
	  at Perkin Elmer as an Associate QA Engineer. In this report I will talk about the numerous ways I grew as a Student, Employee, and Programmer.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Employer Information </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 20px;">

	  and life science research to name a few. The software, medical imaging components, instruments, and consumables help many end markets. Some of these markets are Animal Health, 
	  Food & Agriculture, and Therapeutic Areas. Their offices are located all over the world, including the United States, Canada, France, South Africa, Japan,

	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Job Description </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
	  While working at PerkinElmer as an Associate QA Engineer, my main job was to assist in testing <a href="https://www.perkinelmer.com/product/signals-medical-review-smr">Signals Medical Review</a>. My role
	  within the team was to test all the bugfixes/changes, both manually and through automation. Working as a tester helped me understand how much testing is required when building software and how important
	  it is to make sure that every time code is added that the added code doesn't disrupt functionality within the system.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Many of the things I did at PerkinElmer Include:
	  <br>
	  - Writing an automated test harness in Java using the <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium framework</a>, as well as <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a>, <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, and <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>.
	  <br>
	  - Running automated test cases in parallel.
	  <br>
	  - Using <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira?aceid=&adposition=1t1&adgroup=59152536674&campaign=1440801501&creative=276117264463&device=c&keyword=jira&matchtype=e&network=g&placement=&ds_kids=p34163685171&ds_e=GOOGLE&ds_eid=700000001558501&ds_e1=GOOGLE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9b7wwP2S3QIVTVmGCh3BngjUEAAYASAAEgJ1wfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Jira</a>, 
	  creating test cases, pushing issues from "in test" to "done" after running them through all the related test cycles.
	  <br>
	  - <a href="https://support.sas.com/en/support-home.html">Sas Programming</a> to update existing data sets to use for <a href="http://www.testingperformance.org/definitions/what-is-soak-testing">soak testing</a>.
	  <br>
	  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_testing">Stability testing</a>, testing all the parameters for specific functionalities within the system, testing concurency within the system.
	  <br>
	  - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">Regression testing</a>, running through hundreds of test cases after deployments in both DEV and QA environments.
	  <br>
	  - <a href="https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfire">Tibco Spotfire</a>, Data visualizations
	  <br>
	  - Batch scripting
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <h2 class="work-term-report-head"> Goals </h2>
	  <p style="font-size: 20px">
	  My main goals while working for PerkinElmer was to increase my abilities as a programmer, as well as grow within a profesional environment. I wanted to work on my communication skills as well as be more
	  comfortable talking in front of my team.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  My goals for the first 4 months were:
	  <br>
	  1. Be more confortable with agile development
	  <br>
	  2. Learn the selenium framework and improve my java skills
	  <br>
	  3. Be less afraid to ask for help if I don't understand something
	  </p>
	  <br>
	   <p style="font-size: 20px">
	  Having standup meetings every morning helped me immensly with getting more comfortable with agile. It also helped with my communication as I needed to be able to articulate what I had been working on. Once 
	  a month my supervisor and I would meet to reflect on my goals and to see what other steps could be taken to reaching them, which was very helpful for my learning.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  My goals for the last 4 months were
	  <br>
	  1. Improve communication with team during standup meetings
	  <br>
	  2. Continue to improve coding abilities
	  <br>
	  3. Take charge more during tasks
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  After the first 4 months while my coding abilities and my communication was improving, I realized that I still needed to work on leadership and being more proactive with my work. I attempted this during
	  soak testing by working on and seting up automated scripts while also trying to help set up a test plan. I continued to improve my coding abilities by reading tech articles and learning new languages/technologies
	  during down time.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  Reflecting on my goals and everything I've learned while working at PerkinElmer, I believe I was extremly successful in improving my communication and teamwork skills, as well as improving my coding skills.
	  I learned how to write code using the selenium framework which was a very interesting challenge as I had never worked with automation before. I learned how to use sas programming, as well as using batch files
	  to set up automated scripts for soak testing.
	  </p>
