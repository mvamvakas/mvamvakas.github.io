        - Programming in the
        <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.Net</a> Framework<br />
        - Working with the <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> Framework
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2 class="work-term-report-head">Goals</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 20px">
        My main goals while working for PerkinElmer were to increase my
        abilities as a programmer, as well as grow within a professional
        environment. I wanted to work on my communication skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        My goals for the first 4 months were:
        <br />
        1. Improve abilities with the .net framework
        <br />
        2. Learn more about how to properly use Agile
        <br />
        3. Be more active at attempting problems I don't know how to solve
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="font-size: 20px">
        As I had never worked with the .Net Framework before heading into this
        work term so my main goal during my first 4 months was to learn as much
        as I can about C#, Angular, and the .Net Framework as a whole. My other
        important goal was to make a greater effort to take on tasks I had no
        idea how to solve and trying to work through them. I also had a a goal
        to learn more about Agile as there is almost more to learn and improve
        when working with it.
        <br />
        <br />
        My goals for the last 4 months were
        <br />
        1. Learn more about .Net
        <br />
        2. Stay motivated and focused while working from home
        <br />
        3. Increase my ability to problem solve
        <br />
        <br />
        After the first four months I realized I still have a long way to go
        with the .Net Framework, so I wanted to continue focusing on learning as
        much as I can about it as I could. My secondary goal was to try to stay
        as motivated as possible while working from home. As I have ADD working
        from home full time and staying focused on task proved to be quite the
        challenge. It started out badly but as time went on I feel I adjusted to
        working from home quite well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Reflecting on my goals and everything I've learned while working at
        PerkinElmer, I believe that I had an extremely successful work term.
        Despite the COVID-19 kicking me out of the office 2.5 months I feel I
        improved my programming skills a lot and had a great time working for
        PerkinElmer.
      </p>
